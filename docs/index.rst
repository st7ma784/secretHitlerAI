Welcome to Secret Hitler AI Documentation
==========================================

Secret Hitler AI is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to play the strategic social deduction game Secret Hitler. This project combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with game theory to create intelligent agents capable of strategic gameplay, deception, and social reasoning.

.. note::
   This project is for educational and research purposes, exploring AI capabilities in strategic social games.

Quick Start
-----------

Get started with Secret Hitler AI in just a few steps:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secretHitlerAI.git
   cd secretHitlerAI

   # Start with Docker Compose
   docker-compose up

   # Access the training interface
   open http://localhost:8000/training

.. tip::
   For GPU-accelerated training, use the training profile:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      docker-compose --profile training up

System Architecture
-------------------

The Secret Hitler AI system follows a modular, scalable architecture:

Key Components
--------------

**Strategy Analysis System**
   Comprehensive gameplay analysis derived from 10,000+ AI vs AI games, revealing optimal strategies, behavioral patterns, and psychological insights with mathematical precision.

**LLM Training System**
   Advanced language model fine-tuning using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) for parameter-efficient strategic optimization.

**Agent World View**
   Comprehensive strategic context system that maintains player profiles, voting history, conversation analysis, and strategic recommendations for intelligent decision-making.

**Enhanced AI Agents**
   Role-specific intelligent agents (Liberal, Fascist, Hitler) with continuous learning capabilities, performance tracking, and strategic adaptation.

**Training Infrastructure**
   Automated self-training orchestration with curriculum learning, multi-agent coordination, and comprehensive performance monitoring.

**Checkpoint Management**
   Intelligent model persistence with automatic cleanup, metadata tracking, and recovery mechanisms for robust training workflows.
